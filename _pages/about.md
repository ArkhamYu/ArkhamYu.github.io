I am **Yu Gan (甘宇)**, a first-year Ph.D. student in *Computer Science* at the *School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh*. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Junyu Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/junyuliu/main).

My research interests lie broadly in *quantum information science*, including *quantum error correction*, *quantum communication*, and *quantum information theory*. Recently, I have been particularly interested in distributed fault-tolerant architectures and quantum repeater protocols.

Before coming to Pittsburgh (starting my Ph.D. in *December 2024*), I received my *B.Eng. in Communication Engineering* from the *University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)* (2017–2021) in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, and my *M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)* from the *University of Michigan* (2021–2023).

I originally studied communication engineering as an undergraduate, where I developed a strong interest in information theory after first encountering the work of **Claude Shannon**. This motivation led me to pursue my master's degree at the *University of Michigan*, his alma mater, where I focused on communication systems and coding theory. During that period, I became increasingly fascinated by *quantum error-correcting codes* and *quantum information*, which ultimately shaped my current research direction.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading literature—especially works by *Albert Camus*, *Franz Kafka*, *Fyodor Dostoevsky*, and *Wang Xiaobo*. I am also a football fan; I served as the captain of my department’s football team during my undergraduate studies, and my favorite team has always been the *Spanish national team*.
