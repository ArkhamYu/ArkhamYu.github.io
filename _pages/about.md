I am **Yu Gan (甘宇)**, a first-year Ph.D. student in **Computer Science** at the **School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh**. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Junyu Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/junyuliu/main).

My research interests lie broadly in **quantum information science**, including **quantum error correction**, **quantum communication**, and **quantum information theory**. Recently, I have been particularly interested in distributed fault-tolerant architectures and quantum repeater protocols.

Before coming to Pittsburgh (starting my Ph.D. in **December 2024**), I received my **B.Eng. in Communication Engineering** from the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)** in **Chengdu, Sichuan, China** (2017–2021), and my **M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)** from the **University of Michigan** (2021–2023).

I am originally from **Chengdu, Sichuan, China**. Outside research, I enjoy thinking about how practical quantum networks and robust quantum algorithms can be built step by step—from theory to real-world implementations.
