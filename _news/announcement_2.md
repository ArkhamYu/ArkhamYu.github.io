In July 2025, I visited **Finland**, spending time at the **University of Helsinki** to meet with  
[Prof. Zoltán Zimborás](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZVZBpU4AAAAJ&hl=en), whose work in quantum algorithms, quantum walk techniques, and Hamiltonian complexity has been highly influential.

During this visit, I also had the opportunity to tour **[Algorithmiq](https://algorithmiq.fi/)** in Helsinki — a leading quantum computing startup focused on near-term quantum algorithms, quantum chemistry, and practical noise-resilient computation. The discussions were inspiring and gave me new perspectives on quantum technologies and real-world quantum applications.
