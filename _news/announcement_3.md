I attended **IEEE Quantum Week (QCE25)** in Albuquerque, New Mexico (<https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2025/>). The conference was truly inspiring — I met many researchers and engineers from both academia and industry, and had a great time discussing quantum computing, networking, and emerging industrial applications. 🎓✨

Below are some photos from the trip:
